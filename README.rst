cl-poise
========

A port of Clojure's Compojure routing library to Common Lisp

I'm on the fence with regard to the routes implementation in `cl-routes`_,
since it's heavy on the CLOS. I'd rather see a functional approach like
Compojure did.

I'll use cl-routes some, dig into the code, and see if I want to bother with a
purely functional implementation.
